# PH556-Astrophysics-Project
Report and code for the PH556 course project, in which we detected an exoplanet transit with the GROWTH-India telescope.

- `analysis.ipynb` contains all of the MCMC Bayesian fitting stuff, along with plotting code for both the presentation and the report. 
- `sim-analysis.ipynb` contains the testing/practice code for the PyMC3 fitting framework where I tried to fit models starting with ideal/simulated data. 
- `preprocessing.ipynb` contains code for processing the raw FITS files, and doing relative aperture photometry with them to obtain the normalised transit light curve.
